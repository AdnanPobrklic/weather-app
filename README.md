# Weather App

This is a simple Weather App built using React and the WeatherAPI API. The app allows users to enter a city name and get the current weather data for that location. The app also displays additional weather information such as temperature, humidity, pressure, visibility, wind speed, and wind direction.
Installation and Usage

To use the Weather App, simply clone or download the repository and run npm install to install the required dependencies. Then run npm start to start the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Once the app is running, enter a city name in the input field and press Enter to get the current weather data for that location. If the city is not found, an alert will be displayed.
